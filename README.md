My journey into cybersecurity has been shaped by hands-on experience in governance, risk, and compliance (GRC). With a strong foundation in ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type II, and NIST frameworks, I’ve supported audit readiness, control assessments, and risk management initiatives that led to measurable improvements in security posture. I’m passionate about bridging technical controls with business needs to build resilient, compliant environments.

## Objective
I am seeking a remote GRC Analyst role where I can apply my skills in control mapping, risk register management, and compliance documentation to help organizations strengthen their security programs and achieve continuous audit readiness.
